"""
This script merges score files (*.scores) produced by SRST2, only retaining scores of allele calls in every sample. First, it reads files of allele calls to construct a table for
allele calls of every sample. Then, it reads every score file and only add those corresponding to allele calls into a new tab-delimited file. Finally, two files of filtered scores
will be stored under the current working directory, one for MLST allele calls and the other for non-MLST allele calls.

Typical input files:
    1. MLST allele calls: [sample name]_[prefix]__mlst__[MLST database name]__results.txt
    2. non-MLST allele calls: [sample name]_[prefix]__genes__[gene database name]__results.txt
    3. MLST allele-score files: [sample name]_[prefix]__[sample name].[MLST database name].scores
    4. non-MLST allele-score files: [sample name_[prefix]__[sample name].[gene database name].scores
    
Requirements for arguments:
    1. at least one pair of arguments, namely, mlst_calls and mlst_scores, or allele_calls and allele_scores, must be configured.

Example command line:
    python merge_scores.py --mlst_calls *_Kp__mlst__mlstDB__results.txt --mlst_scores *_Kp__*.mlstDB.scores
    --allele_calls *_Kp__genes__geneDB__results.txt --allele_scores *_Kp__*.geneDB.scores --mlst_delimiter '_' --prefix Kp

Other notes:
    Please check that whether the way for parsing file names in the function merge_allele_scores works for your file names because prefixes in the file names would
    violate the format assumption of this function. It is recommended that not to use "." in the prefix.
    This script erases contents of files if these files have the same name as those of output files.
